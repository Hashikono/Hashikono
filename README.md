Hi, I've been mainly a self-taught coder since I was 7 years old. I made my first unofficial code.org website (concerning ocean pollution) when I was 13, personal Minecraft add-ons when I was 14, and deployed a <b>fully functional website</b> at 16. I am also the main developer of the SAIVRS project, a web app that allows schools to deploy a personal school app, integrated with an enhanced reporting system. 

You can check out the site at https://saivrs.org/
